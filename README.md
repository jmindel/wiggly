This is just a little javascript/php/python game that I created, based on the classic "snake" game, but for 4 players.
The wigglyfiles.zip is the web side, and the server.zip is the python server that computes player movements.
Although the server works on both windows and linux, I would recommend hosting it on linux.
It requires a XAMPP/LAMPP server with at least PHP support and a MySQL database. It also requires python with mysql.connector module installed.
